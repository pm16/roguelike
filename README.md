Working on a Rogue-like game. Using [libtcod](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io). This is an exercise to brush up on python. I'm following the [tcod tutorial](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/part-01.html) right now.
# Environment
Using python 3.13.7 and [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod) 19.5.0.
